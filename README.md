# WinegoofsCUE

## Project Description
We are making a website for Winegoofs, a startup that wants wine to become less dandy and easier to understand and enjoy.
On the site itself you will be able to:
- Browse through wines.
- Learn more about wine.
- Buy and rate wine.


We want the site to have a "Slack" feeling, simple and cozy. (as few pages as possible)

Original project details are available [here](https://github.com/herkommer/TE4-w47-Project).
